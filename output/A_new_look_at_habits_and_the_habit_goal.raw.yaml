          title: New Model of Habits in Brief
          note: Habits are learned dispositions to repeat past responses triggered by features of the context that have covaried frequently with past performance. Contexts activate habitual responses directly, without mediation of goal states. The model has three key principles.
        principle1:
          title: Principle 1 - Habits are cued by contexts
          note: Habits are triggered by perception of cues in the performance context that were contiguous with past performance. This can occur through direct cuing (context-response associations formed by repeated co-activation) or motivated cuing (reward value transferred to contexts).
        principle2:  
          title: Principle 2 - No goal mediation
          note: Habit context-response associations are not mediated by representations of goals. Habits differ from goal-dependent automaticity where responses vary based on current goals.
        principle3:
          title: Principle 3 - Habit-goal interface
          note: Habits arise slowly from context-response learning, so they do not alter with current goals. However, goals can guide habit formation, habits can be inferred from goals, and habits interact with goals during performance.

        behaviorism:
          title: Ties to behaviorism
          note: Habits have historical ties to behaviorism and the notion of stimulus-response bonds formed through associative learning.
        cognitive_science:
          title: Cognitive science perspective
          note: Cognitive science rejected simple associationism in favor of top-down, purposive models of human cognition and action.  
        synthesis:
          title: Modern synthesis
          note: A new synthesis incorporates behaviorist tools like context cuing and associative learning within inherently goal-directed models of human action.
